/**
 * Spring-managed entry point for starting connector mocks. The mocks themselves are plain WireMock wrappers with a
 * per-test lifecycle (fresh server on a loopback-bound OS-chosen port per start; callers stop them in
 * {@code @AfterEach}), so they cannot be Spring beans — this factory bridges the two worlds by injecting the beans a
 * mock needs at start. It is the only way to start a mock (constructors are package-private), which guarantees the
 * cryptography-provider mock always seeds its function-group reference data consistently with what it advertises.
 * <p>
 * Each start yields an independent server, so a test may hold several mocks of the same kind at once, and callers reach
 * each through its own {@link BaseConnectorMock#getUrl()}.
