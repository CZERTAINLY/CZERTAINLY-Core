/**
 * Fixed ports for the WireMock stubs that stand in for external services, plus the property assignments that bind those
 * services to them.
 * <p>
 * <b>When a fixed port is warranted</b> — only when the URL must be known before the Spring context is created, so it
 * can be written into a {@code @TestPropertySource} or the test {@code application.yml}. That is the case for the three
 * services below, which the code under test reaches through an injected base URL. A stub whose URL is instead handed
 * over at runtime needs no constant here: it takes an OS-chosen port on the loopback address, which lets several of its
 * kind run at once and keeps test classes independent of each other's port usage. The connector stubs behind
 * {@link com.otilm.core.util.mocks.ConnectorMockFactory} work that way.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why the ports are off the context signature</b> — a per-class {@code @TestPropertySource} forks a context, because
 * {@link com.otilm.core.architecture.ContextSignature} compares the annotation's source text. The
 * {@code *_URL_PROPERTY} assignments below are instead declared once on {@link BaseSpringBootTest} and
 * {@link BaseSpringBootTestNoAuth}, so every subclass inherits identical text and none of them forks.
 * <p>
 * <b>Duplication in YAML</b> — the test {@code application.yml} repeats these ports as literals, because it cannot
 * reference constants, as the floor for the context-loading tests that extend neither base class.
 * {@code WireMockPortsGuardTest} pins the two in sync.
