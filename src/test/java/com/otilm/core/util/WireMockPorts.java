/**
 * Fixed ports for the WireMock stubs that stand in for external services, plus the property assignments that bind those
 * services to them.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why fixed ports are safe</b> — Surefire runs test classes sequentially in one fork, so no two stubs contend for a
 * port, and every class stops its server when it finishes. A fixed port below the 49152 ephemeral floor is also immune
 * to the collisions {@code dynamicPort()} suffers when another process asks for an ephemeral port.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why the ports are off the context signature</b> — a per-class {@code @TestPropertySource} forks a context, because
 * {@link com.otilm.core.architecture.ContextSignature} compares the annotation's source text. The
 * {@code *_URL_PROPERTY} assignments below are instead declared once on {@link BaseSpringBootTest} and
 * {@link BaseSpringBootTestNoAuth}, so every subclass inherits identical text and none of them forks. Whether two
 * classes stubbing the same service also share a cached context depends on their other context axes; the port is not
 * one of them, which is the point.
 * <p>
 * <b>When a new constant is warranted</b> — only when two stubs must be alive at the same time. That happens within a
 * single class, since separate classes run in sequence and share one port.
 * <p>
 * <b>Duplication in YAML</b> — the test {@code application.yml} repeats these ports as literals, because it cannot
 * reference constants, as the floor for the context-loading tests that extend neither base class.
 * {@code WireMockPortsGuardTest} pins the two in sync.
