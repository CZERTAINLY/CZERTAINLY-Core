/**
 * The evaluator's two callers must reach the same answer.
 *
 * <p>
 * Ingest (core#2073) evaluates in memory from a {@link NormalizedAsset}; the re-evaluation sweep evaluates from a
 * stored row -- the ten folded identity columns plus one elected source's payload. If those disagree, a rule-set bump
 * silently rewrites verdicts that ingest had got right, and only for the assets whose derivation touched whatever
 * differs.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>The stored fixture is folded, never hand-typed, and that is the point of the test.</b> Writing
 * {@code new CryptoAssetIdentityFields(..., "X-Wing", ...)} by hand would pass while the real thing failed: the column
 * holds {@link CryptoAssetIdentityFields#normalized()}'s output, which lowercases the family, and
 * {@code AssetNormalizer} compares family tokens case-sensitively -- {@code HYBRID_FAMILIES.contains(winner)} against
 * {@code Set.of("X-Wing")}. A folded {@code x-wing} therefore took the non-hybrid scan path and re-derived different
 * components, so the sweep disagreed with ingest about exactly the hybrids these rules exist to catch. Building the
 * fixture through the real fold is what makes the test able to fail.
