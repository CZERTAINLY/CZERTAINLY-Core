/**
 * A stable row key for persistence tests, derived from the typed fields alone.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>This is a test fixture, not the identity rule.</b> The real key is routed by asset type and built from the whole
 * component -- a content digest, a composite resolving a reference across the document, document-scoped refutation --
 * and it is proven byte for byte by the ratified vector suite. None of that is reachable from ten columns, and none of
 * it is what these tests are about: they exercise upsert, dedup, guards and the merge, and for that they need only a
 * key that is a stable function of the fields.
 *
 * <p>
 * It derives from {@link CryptoAssetIdentityFields#normalized()} rather than the raw fields so that the assertions
 * which depend on it keep the meaning they had when the writer computed the key itself -- {@code "AES"} and
 * {@code "  aes  "} must still land on one row. What changed is only where that decision is made: the writer now
 * accepts a key, and the pipeline is what guarantees the key describes the asset.
