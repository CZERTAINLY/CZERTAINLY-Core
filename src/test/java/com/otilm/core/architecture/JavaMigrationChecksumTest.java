 * checksum from that enum, and Flyway compares the value against the one recorded when the migration ran: register a
 * number that does not belong to the file and every deployment that already ran it refuses to start with a validation
 * error.
 * <p>
 * Only the entries not marked {@code isAltered} are checked. That flag records the ones deliberately frozen at an
 * older value - their source has since changed and re-deriving the checksum would be the very breakage above.
