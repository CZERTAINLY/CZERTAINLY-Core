/**
 * Fails the build if {@code crypto_asset.identity_key} can reach a client, a log or the search allowlist.
 *
 * <p>
 * The key is a hash over a low-entropy preimage — algorithm family, parameter set, curve. Handed the key, an attacker
 * recovers the material by dictionary attack, which is why the redaction ruling in core#2070 rests on the value never
 * leaving the database and on nothing else. Four rules, one kernel:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>no member naming the key may be declared in a client-facing package, the imported contract artifact
 * included;</li>
 * <li>{@code FilterField} — the search allowlist — must not name it;</li>
 * <li>no production source may name it outside persistence, and none may log it, not even the persistence sources that
 * legitimately hold it;</li>
 * <li>no production class may read an accessor that returns the key or its pre-image unless its source is allowlisted
 * for that value — the rule that sees {@code extracted.key()}, which names nothing the three text rules can match.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * The decision procedure lives in {@link IdentityKeyExposureFence}, so {@link IdentityKeyExposureFenceSelfTest} can
 * feed it planted leaks and prove this fence is able to fail. A fence that has never been seen to fail is not evidence.
