/**
 * The rule kernel behind the crypto-asset identity-key redaction fence.

 * <p>
 * {@code crypto_asset.identity_key} is a hash over a low-entropy preimage: handed the key, an attacker recovers the
 * material by dictionary attack. The redaction ruling in core#2070 rests on the key never leaving the database, and on
 * nothing else. This class holds the decision procedure; {@link IdentityKeyExposureFenceArchTest} feeds it the real
 * code base and {@link IdentityKeyExposureFenceSelfTest} feeds it planted leaks, so the fence is proven able to fail.
 *
 * <p>
 * Every method is static and pure over its arguments — no classpath scanning, no file reads outside the explicit
 * {@link #sourceFileViolations(Path, List)} entry point — which is what lets the self-test exercise the same code the
 * real scan runs.
