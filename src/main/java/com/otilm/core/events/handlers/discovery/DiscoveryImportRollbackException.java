/**
 * Carries an already-shaped, exposure-safe reason out of a group import that has to roll back.
 *
 * <p>Throwing is what rolls the transaction back, so the reason has to survive the throw. Without a type
 * {@link DiscoveryFailureReason} recognises, the caller's own shaping would see an unclassified wrapper and replace
 * the reason it carries with generic text.
 *
 * <p>This is the only type whose message {@link DiscoveryFailureReason} forwards to {@code processedError}. Every
 * message reaching an instance of it has been through that shaping already, which is what makes forwarding safe —
 * {@link PlatformException} alone is not enough of a guarantee, since it marks a message the platform authored
 * rather than one free of entity data.
