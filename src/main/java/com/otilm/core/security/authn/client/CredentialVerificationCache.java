/**
 * Positive-only, peppered verification cache for TSP credential authentication.

 * Only successful authentication verifications are stored; callers must never invoke {@link #putSuccess} on a failed
 * authentication. The cache key is an HMAC-SHA-256 over {@code secretUuid + ":" + password} using a per-process pepper
 * (never persisted), so raw passwords are never stored or reconstructable from cache state.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Staleness contract.</b> Method {@link #getMappedUser} does <b>not</b> re-check per-request liveness of the mapped
 * user. Eviction is tied to credential lifecycle only: password rotation, mapped-user reassignment, credential
 * deletion, and secret-content updates (see {@link #evictBySecretUuid}). Account-level changes that do not touch the
 * credential — notably a mapped user being <b>disabled or deprovisioned</b> — are NOT evicted. This is a deliberately
 * accepted, TTL-bounded trade-off: user-disable is rare and a per-request liveness check on the signing hot-path is not
 * affordable.
