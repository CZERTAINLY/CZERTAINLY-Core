     * The canonical form the platform stores: every producer-text field folded, and a field that is blank after folding
     * stored as absent rather than as whitespace.
     *
     * <p>
     * Storing this rather than the raw input is what makes a filter answer independent of ingest order. The row's
     * columns used to be reassigned from whichever producer synced last, so an {@code EQUALS} predicate matched or
     * missed depending on sync order, and a field one producer omitted and another sent as {@code "  "} moved the row
     * in and out of an {@code EMPTY} result set. Nine of the fourteen crypto-asset filter fields were exposed to that.
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>What this does not buy, corrected.</b> This method used to claim the stored row was sufficient to re-derive
     * its own key, so a staleness sweep could re-key from the columns alone. That is false under the ratified rules and
     * was false the moment the identity chain became tier-routed. A certificate keyed on the distinguished-name
     * composite hashes subject, issuer, both validity bounds and a resolved public key; none of those five is a column.
     * So {@code ruleset_version} still makes a stale row <em>findable</em>, but repairing one means re-ingesting its
     * source document -- which is the sync path's job, not a sweep over this table.
     *
     * <p>
     * The fold is NFKC, then case, then NFKC again. The order is not interchangeable: a compatibility character has no
     * case mapping of its own, so folding first leaves {@code U+1D400 MATHEMATICAL BOLD CAPITAL A} untouched and NFKC
     * then yields {@code A} -- an uppercase result out of a case fold. The second pass exists because a full case
     * mapping can itself emit an unnormalised sequence. Case folding uses {@link Locale#ROOT}, never the platform
     * default: a Turkish-locale JVM folds {@code I} to a dotless {@code i}, so two nodes of one cluster would write
     * different values into the same column.
     *
     * <p>
     * Stripping happens <em>after</em> NFKC and uses {@link String#strip()} rather than {@link String#trim()}, because
     * both orders and both methods decide different things about Unicode space: {@code trim} removes only characters at
     * or below {@code U+0020}, so a trailing {@code U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE} would survive it and NFKC would then turn it
     * into an ordinary trailing space -- storing {@code "RSA "} where another producer stored {@code "RSA"}.
     *
     * <p>
     * {@code assetType} is passed through: it is this platform's own enum constant, already canonical, and running the
     * producer-text fold over it would imply it is producer text.
