/**
 * Renders a value into one slot of an identity pre-image, percent-escaping the delimiter set.
 *
 * <p>
 * The hazard is concrete, not theoretical. A producer-controlled {@code relatedCryptoMaterialProperties.id} of
 * {@code abc|F|x} produces the pre-image {@code MAT|secret-key|I|abc|F|x} -- which is exactly the shape a
 * fingerprint-tier asset emits, so a sloppy or hostile producer could forge a collision with a different tier of the
 * chain. Escaping is lossless, so no two distinct values are ever conflated.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Outer slots only.</b> A value that lands in a slot of the pre-image is escaped; a value that goes into a string
 * which is then <em>hashed</em>, with only the digest reaching a slot, is left literal. The distinguished-name
 * composite is the worked example: {@code CRT|S|v1|...} carries {@code 2.5.4.3=example%20ca} because that DN sits in an
 * outer slot, while the composite's inner pre-image carries {@code 2.5.4.3=vector ca} with the space intact, because
 * only its SHA-256 enters a slot. Getting this backwards re-keys every certificate.
