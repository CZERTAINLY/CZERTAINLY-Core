 * Version-agnostic by construction. Nothing here reads {@code specVersion}: 1.6 and 1.7 differ in field <em>names</em>
 * -- {@code curve} became {@code ellipticCurve}, and every reference field was renamed -- and those differences are
 * absorbed by the normalizer reading both spellings and by the hashed projection stripping references before any
 * digest. A walker that branched on the declared version would have to be right about a value producers get wrong: one
 * really does ship {@code specVersion} as the number {@code 999}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Nothing a producer can write makes this throw.</b> A component that cannot be keyed is reported as a skip and the
 * walk continues, because one malformed asset must not cost an operator the other four thousand. The skips are values,
 * not log lines: a document is untrusted input, and a walker that logged what it could not parse would print
 * pre-redaction content into an appender the redaction proof does not cover.
