/**
 * Ordering a caller asked for, addressed the way a filter addresses a field: a source plus an identifier that is unique
 * only within that source. Carried instead of a ready-made {@code Order} lambda so the repository can decide how the
 * ordering interacts with the rest of the query it builds - the {@code SELECT DISTINCT} it emits, and the tie-break it
 * appends to keep paging stable.
 *
 * <p>
 * An attribute-sourced sort additionally carries the resource whose catalogue it was resolved against and the caller's
 * custom-attribute content permissions. Neither can be recovered from the entity root: a resource without a
 * {@code ResourceToClass} entry maps to no resource at all, and permissions live on the request rather than on the
 * query. Both are supplied by {@code ListingSortResolver}, which is the only thing that may build one; a specification
 * that reaches the attribute sort key without them is refused rather than run unauthorized.
 *
 * @param resource the resource the listing selects, or {@code null} for a specification built without one
 * @param attributeContentFilter the caller's custom-attribute permissions, or {@code null} when no attribute sort was
 * resolved
