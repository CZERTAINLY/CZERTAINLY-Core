     * <b>Concurrency:</b> atomic on the unique {@code (asset_uuid, cbom_uuid)} -- a re-sync of an unchanged document
     * rewrites the row rather than creating a second one.
     *
     * <p>
     * The seen-at pair is merged with {@code LEAST}/{@code GREATEST} rather than assigned, so the row always holds a
     * real window. Keeping {@code first_seen_at} and overwriting {@code last_seen_at} would look equivalent only while
     * events arrive in order: a retry, a replayed document or two nodes ingesting the same CBOM can present an older
     * {@code seenAt} after a newer one, and a plain assignment would then store a {@code last_seen_at} that precedes
     * {@code first_seen_at}. {@code occurrence_count} is the unclipped count, so the gap against the retained
     * {@code evidence} array records that capping happened.
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>The content follows the newest observation, not the newest arrival.</b> The same out-of-order input the window
     * merge exists for would otherwise leave stale content under a window claiming the newer sync: an arrival carrying
     * an older {@code seenAt} would overwrite the payload, the evidence and the counts, and
     * {@link CryptoAssetRepository#recomputeMergeFromSources} would re-elect on it -- so the row would attest "as of
     * {@code last_seen_at} this CBOM said X" at an instant when it said Y. That is a state that was never true, and the
     * wire calls this payload what the source declared. Every content column is therefore gated on the same recency
     * test, so the ones that must move together -- payload with its hash and leaf count, evidence with its count --
     * cannot come apart. A strictly older arrival widens the window and changes nothing else.
     *
     * <p>
     * The comparison is {@code >=} rather than {@code >} deliberately. If the ingest path ends up deriving
     * {@code seenAt} from the document rather than from the extraction run, every re-ingest is a tie; under {@code >}
     * the content would then freeze forever and a re-extraction under upgraded code could never refresh the row. Under
     * {@code >=} a tie refreshes, which degrades to the previous behaviour rather than to a silent floor.
