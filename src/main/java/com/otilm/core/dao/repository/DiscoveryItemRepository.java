     *
     * <p>
     * The resource filter is applied inside each branch, before the union, so a single-resource query reads one table
     * and the other branch is pruned on a constant. The {@code newlyDiscovered} filter is applied to the certificate
     * branch <i>after</i> its numbering, so a row keeps the same synthesized number whether or not the caller filtered.

     * {@code i_cre} must be a timestamp for the {@code discovered_at} coalesce below to plan at all. It is the one
     * audited column in the schema declared {@code VARCHAR}, and a regression here is invisible to tests: they build
     * their schema from the entities, which map it as a timestamp whatever the migration says.

    // Two phases, and the split is what keeps a page cheap. The union orders and limits on narrow columns alone,
    // carrying a certificate row's content_id rather than its content; the payload is built afterwards, for the page's
    // rows only. Built inside the union it would sit in the target list of a windowed subquery, so every certificate
    // in the run -- not just the page -- would have its content read out of TOAST and wrapped in JSON on every request.
    //
    // Aliases on the outer select are quoted because Postgres folds an unquoted one to lower case, and the projection
    // binds by exact column label; inside the union they stay unquoted, since the outer query refers to them by name.
    // Ordering inside the union is positional: only the first branch's labels are in scope there, and a qualified
    // reference to them is not. The outer ORDER BY repeats it by name -- a CTE's own ordering is not guaranteed to
    // survive into the query that selects from it.
