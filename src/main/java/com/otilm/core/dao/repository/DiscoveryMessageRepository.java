     * Records one occurrence group of a problem, aggregating onto the row already carrying it.
     *
     * <p>
     * No lock is taken anywhere: a concurrent append of the same problem loses the race to the unique index and lands
     * in the {@code DO UPDATE}, so the two counts add rather than one overwriting the other. The bound is a guard on
     * new rows only — a repeat always lands, however many rows the run already has, because aggregating onto an
     * existing row grows nothing.
     *
     * <p>
     * The window widens, never moves. {@code now()} is transaction-start time, so a transaction that began earlier can
     * commit later and would otherwise rewind {@code last_seen_at} — past {@code first_seen_at} entirely, when it
     * aggregates onto a row a shorter, later transaction created. {@code LEAST}/{@code GREATEST} make both ends
     * monotonic, which is what lets the pair be read as the span a fault was active.
     *
     * <p>
     * The bounds are soft ceilings, not guarantees: the counts and the insert are not atomic against each other, so
     * appenders that each read a count one below the limit all pass and a run can exceed it by the number of concurrent
     * appenders. Locking to close that would reintroduce the serialisation this design removes.
     *
     * @return 1 when the message was recorded, 0 when a bound refused it a row of its own
