/**
 * Outcome of a {@link PollFeature#pollCertificate} call. Three possibilities:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Reached} — the certificate transitioned to the expected terminal state within the poll-timeout window.
 * Caller proceeds with the normal success path.</li>
 * <li>{@link StillPending} — the certificate is in {@code PENDING_ISSUE} or {@code PENDING_REVOKE}. The authority
 * provider connector accepted the operation asynchronously (HTTP 202) and completion is out-of-band. CMP callers
 * translate this into a {@code pollRep} for issue/renew/rekey, or a per-certificate {@code rejection} for revocation
 * (RFC 4210 §5.2.6 limits polling to ip/cp/kup). SCEP callers translate to {@code pkiPending}.</li>
 * <li>{@link Diverted} — the certificate reached a terminal state that is <em>not</em> the expected one. Most likely
 * cause: another thread (e.g. an operator-driven {@code cancelPendingCertificateOperation}, a scheduled task)
 * transitioned the certificate while this poll was running. Callers reject the operation cleanly; the upstream
 * operation is no longer in progress and the {@code currentState} carried by the result tells the caller (and the
 * user-facing message) what the certificate ended up in.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Timeout is intentionally not represented here: it is a system-level condition (the polling thread did not observe a
 * state transition within the configured budget), not a domain outcome, and is signalled by a checked
 * {@link com.otilm.api.interfaces.core.cmp.error.CmpProcessingException} on the polling method.
