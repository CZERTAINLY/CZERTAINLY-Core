/**

 * <p>
 * {@code REQUIRED}, so the tombstone commits with the deletion it describes or with neither. A tombstone written by a
 * transaction that then rolled back would claim a deletion that never happened, and a deletion without a tombstone
 * leaves the next sync free to re-ingest the document.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>No production caller yet.</b> The delete path must record a tombstone as it deletes, or the next sync finds the
 * document upstream, sees nothing in the live {@code cbom} table, and re-ingests exactly what an operator removed —
 * which is the scenario this table exists to prevent. That wiring arrives with the ingest ticket, alongside the source
 * detachment the RESTRICT foreign key requires.
