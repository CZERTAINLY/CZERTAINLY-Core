/**
 * The one transaction that creates a discovery run.
 *
 * <p>
 * Creating a run needs the connector — it publishes the per-resource attribute definitions the request's content is
 * filed against — but a connector call must never hold a transaction open. So the caller resolves everything the
 * connector has to say first, outside any transaction, and hands the answers here as data. This bean then commits the
 * run and everything belonging to it together. Filing those writes independently instead leaves a run row behind on any
 * later failure: {@code IN_PROGRESS}, missing its attributes or triggers, and reachable only to be deleted.
 *
 * <p>
 * The detail is mapped in here, inside the same transaction, because the entity's associations are lazy and the caller
 * — running {@code NOT_SUPPORTED} so it can talk to the connector — has no transaction to load them in.
