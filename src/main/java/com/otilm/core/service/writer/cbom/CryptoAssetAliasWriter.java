/**
 * Short transactional writes against {@code crypto_asset_alias} -- the repair path for an accidental duplicate.
 *
 * <p>
 * An alias never reaches identity. The key is a function of ten typed columns, so recording, re-pointing or removing an
 * alias cannot change any row's key; it changes only which row a later ingest lands on. That is also why the repair is
 * exactly reversible: every source keeps its own payload, so removing the alias and re-ingesting re-splits the rows
 * from evidence that was never discarded.
 *
 * <p>
 * An alias is <b>refused</b> where a safety rule caused the split. A guarded row was kept separate on purpose -- a
 * refuted certificate digest, a bare common name facing a full subject DN, a refuted OID -- and merging it would assert
 * an identity the evidence refuted. Chains are refused too: an alias whose absorbed key is another alias's canonical
 * key, or whose canonical key is itself absorbed, has no single reversal.
