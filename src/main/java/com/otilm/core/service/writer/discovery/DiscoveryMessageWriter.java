/**
 * The one way anything writes to a run's message log, and the one place its bounds are enforced.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>The bounds are fixed, not configured.</b> They are safety limits against a producer or a connector that
 * misbehaves, not tuning dials — a well-behaved run reaches around sixteen distinct kinds against a ceiling of fifty,
 * and no deployment holds information that would tell it to move one.
 *
 * <p>
 * An append never takes the run row's write lock: the upsert aggregates a repeat onto the row already carrying it, so
 * two appenders add their counts instead of one overwriting the other. That is what lets a producer record a problem
 * without queueing behind whatever else is holding the run.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>{@code REQUIRED} throughout, never {@code REQUIRES_NEW}.</b> Most callers append while holding the run row's
 * {@code SELECT ... FOR UPDATE}, and the row inserted here takes a {@code FOR KEY SHARE} lock on that same run row
 * through its foreign key. From a separate transaction that wait can never be satisfied — the append would block on a
 * lock its own caller holds, and the run would hang rather than fail.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Overflow drops the newest and keeps the oldest.</b> A bound refuses new rows once reached; it never evicts one
 * already recorded. An operator opening a degraded run is looking for what started it, and the log a run keeps must
 * still contain that after the same fault has repeated ten thousand times.
