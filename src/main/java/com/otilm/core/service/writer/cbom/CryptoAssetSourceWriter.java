/**
 * Short transactional writes against {@code crypto_asset_source}, each of which also re-derives the owning asset's
 * merge bookkeeping in the same transaction.
 *
 * <p>
 * The two are inseparable on purpose: {@code crypto_asset.merged_crypto_properties} is one source's retained payload,
 * so a source change that did not re-elect would leave the asset attributing its payload to a source that no longer
 * says that -- or, on removal, to a source that no longer exists.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Lock order.</b> The inventory has two lock classes and they are ranked, because a transaction can hold both:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link CryptoAssetAliasWriter#ALIAS_DECISION_LOCK}, the cluster advisory lock over alias and guard
 * decisions;</li>
 * <li>the {@code crypto_asset} row lock, then the {@code crypto_asset_source} row.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both methods here take the asset's row lock before touching a source row. {@code crypto_asset} and
 * {@code crypto_asset_source} reference each other, so a path that locked the source first would deadlock against a
 * concurrent ingest on the same pair; locking asset-then-source closes that cycle. Neither method takes the advisory
 * lock at all, so neither can be the transaction that holds a row and then waits for it.
 *
 * <p>
 * That is the constraint an orchestrator has to preserve, and it is the one this class cannot enforce for its caller.
 * {@link CryptoAssetWriter#upsertIdentity} takes the advisory lock when it stamps a guard. A transaction that upserts a
 * source for one asset and then stamps a guard on another would hold a row lock while waiting for the advisory lock,
 * and a concurrent transaction doing the reverse would deadlock against it. <b>An ingest that may stamp a guard must
 * therefore take the advisory lock once, up front, before its first asset row lock</b> -- it is re-entrant within a
 * transaction, so acquiring it early costs a later acquisition nothing. That wiring belongs to the ingest ticket, which
 * is also what first makes the interleaving reachable: nothing composes these writers today.
