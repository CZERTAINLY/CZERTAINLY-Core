/**
 * Short transactional writes against the {@code discovery_work} agenda. The repository carries no
 * {@code @Transactional} (per the repository rule); every {@code @Modifying} write goes through this bean. Methods are
 * {@code REQUIRED} so an agenda change commits or rolls back with the run state it supervises — except
 * {@link #resetAttempt}, whose callers run outside any usable transaction.
 *
 * <p>
 * A live run's agenda must never be observably empty: the reaper treats a non-terminal run with no agenda rows past its
 * creation grace as lost work. A caller replacing a run's last row therefore deletes and schedules in the same
 * transaction.
