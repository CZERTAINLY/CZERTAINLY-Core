/**
 * Gates and audits every {@link Certificate} state change.
 *
 * <p>
 * Responsibilities (and only these):
 * <ol>
 * <li>Validate (from, to) pair against {@link CertificateStateTransition} table — throw on miss</li>
 * <li>Mutate cert.state + persist via repository</li>
 * <li>Write audit history entry via {@link CertificateEventHistoryInternalService}</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * SM does NOT call entityManager.flush() — callers can mutate the same entity post-transition within the same
 * transaction; mutations flush at commit (Hibernate dirty-tracking).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * SM does NOT drive the side effects (location cleanup, predecessor-relation deletion, dual-cert event history) that
 * the existing v2 client-operations service bundles into its failure handling. The caller remains responsible for
 * those.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The SM is intentionally lock-free. Concurrency on a single certificate is the caller's responsibility: operator paths
 * and the async poll listener acquire a pessimistic lock (findAndLockWithAssociationsByUuid) and re-assert state before
 * calling transition(), so the read-modify-write here runs under that lock. See the activation slice for the locked
 * call sites.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * SM governs state CHANGES, not initial assignment at row creation. Paths that set state directly on a new Certificate
 * (CertificateServiceImpl.createPlaceholder, CertificateUtil.prepareIssuedCertificate) bypass the SM by design.
 * </p>
