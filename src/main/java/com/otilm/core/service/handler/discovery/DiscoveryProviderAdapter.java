/**
 * The version seam for discovery provider interaction: one implementation per connector discovery interface generation,
 * selected by {@link DiscoveryProviderAdapterFactory}.

 * <p>
 * {@code start} takes the run's uuid rather than the entity: the v1 flow reloads the run with its associations inside
 * its own transaction boundaries, because it executes asynchronously in a different session than the one that created
 * the run.
 *
 * <p>
 * Lifecycle refusals carry meaning: {@code UnsupportedOperationException} means the connector generation can never
 * perform the operation (callers map it to the contract's 422); an adapter whose implementation is merely pending
 * signals that with {@link IllegalStateException} instead — a defect, not part of this contract.
