/**
 * Drives the async-operation polling cadence off the {@code certificate_status_poll} due-time table. Every node
 * triggers this on its own timer (see {@link CertificateStatusPollSweepScheduler}); a cluster-wide advisory lock
 * ({@link ClusterOperationSynchronizer.Operation#PROVIDER_STATUS_POLL_SWEEP}) keeps exactly one node sweeping at a
 * time.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each round {@link CertificateStatusPollClaimer#claimDueBatch} reads the due rows and advances their
 * {@code next_poll_at} under the lock (database only), then this orchestrator sends the poll messages <em>outside</em>
 * the lock and transaction — the broker round-trips must never pin the advisory lock or a DB connection. A lost poll
 * message is self-correcting: the row stays scheduled and is re-enqueued (at the advanced attempt) when next due.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The poll phase owns only scheduling; the listener owns the async poll flow's state transitions and deletes the row on
 * a terminal outcome or timeout. As a final phase the sweep also reaps certificates orphaned in {@code PENDING_ISSUE}
 * with no poll row (see {@link PendingIssueReaper}).
 * </p>
