/**
 * Typed {@code AttributeResource -> SecuredUUID-guarded loader} registry. Callback-mode expansion resolves
 * <strong>only</strong> through this map, and every value is a {@link CallerAuthorizedReferenceLoader} — i.e. a
 * per-object guarded entrypoint taking a {@code SecuredUUID}.
 * <p>
 * CREDENTIAL/AUTHORITY/ENTITY/LOCATION resolve via {@code <KIND>:DETAIL}; SECRET resolves via
 * {@code SECRET:GET_SECRET_CONTENT} plus vault-profile membership (the established secret-content gate). SECRET is
 * dereferenced because a <strong>stored</strong> SECRET reference carried in a scope blob (for example an authority's
 * OAuth-client secret) is unusable to a stateless connector as a bare reference — Core must resolve it. This is
 * distinct from a <strong>user-typed</strong> secret in {@code currentAttributes}, which is an inline first-delivery
 * value (not a {@code ResourceObjectContent} reference) and so is never walked by the expander.
 * <p>
 * CERTIFICATE stays absent (no connector-consumable blob) and is passed through as a plain reference.
 * <p>
 * Each value is a method reference onto the guarded service method, so this class never references an unguarded by-UUID
 * primitive itself — the wiring stays inside the type-level fence.
