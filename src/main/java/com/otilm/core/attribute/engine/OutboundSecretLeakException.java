/**
 * Raised by {@link OutboundSecretContainment} when an FE-bound callback response would carry secret material the
 * expander materialized server-side — either by echoing an expanded secret value or by structurally containing a
 * secret-bearing content shape. The NG dispatcher throws this before forwarding, so the offending response is never
 * returned to the FE (fail-closed). The message is a fixed, secret-free string. Mapping it to a dedicated
 * connector-contract HTTP status is a follow-up; today it propagates as a generic server error.
