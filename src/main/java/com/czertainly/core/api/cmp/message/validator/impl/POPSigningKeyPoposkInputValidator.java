 * <p>POP validator:

 *        signature               BIT STRING }
 *    </pre>
 *    <p>The fields of POPOSigningKey have the following meaning:</p>
 *
 *       <p><i>poposkInput</i> contains the data to be signed, when present.  This
 *       field MUST be present when the certificate template does not
 *       contain both the public key value and a subject name value.<p>
 *
 *       <p><i>algorithmIdentifier</i> identifiers the signature algorithm and an
 *       associated parameters used to produce the POP value.<p>
 *
 *       </p><i>signature</i> contains the POP value produce.  If poposkInput is
 *       present, the signature is computed over the DER-encoded value of
 *       poposkInput.  If poposkInput is absent, the signature is computed
 *       over the DER-encoded value of certReq.<p>
 *
 *    <pre>
 *    POPOSigningKeyInput ::= SEQUENCE {
 *        authInfo            CHOICE {

 *            -- used only if an authenticated identity has been
 *            -- established for the sender (e.g., a DN from a
 *            -- previously-issued and currently-valid certificate)
 *            publicKeyMAC        PKMACValue },
 *            -- used if no authenticated GeneralName currently exists for
 *            -- the sender; publicKeyMAC contains a password-based MAC
 *            -- on the DER-encoded value of publicKey
 *        publicKey           SubjectPublicKeyInfo }  -- from CertTemplate
 *    </pre>
 *
 *    <p>
 *    The fields of POPOSigningKeyInput have the following meaning:</p>
 *
 *       <p>
 *       <i>sender</i> contains an authenticated identity that has been previously
 *       established for the subject.</p>
 *
 *       <p>
 *       <i>publicKeyMAC</i> contains a computed value that uses a shared secret
 *       between the CA/RA and the certificate requestor.</p>
 *
 *       <p>
 *       <i>publicKey<i> contains a copy of the public key from the certificate
 *       template.  This MUST be exactly the same value as is contained in
 *       the certificate template.</p>
 *
 *    <pre>
 *    PKMACValue ::= SEQUENCE {
 *       algId  AlgorithmIdentifier,
 *       value  BIT STRING }
 *    </pre>
 *
 *    <p>
 *    The fields of PKMACValue have the following meaning:</p>
 *
 *       <p>
 *       algId identifies the algorithm used to compute the MAC value.  All
 *       implementations MUST support id-PasswordBasedMAC.  The details on
 *       this algorithm are presented in section 4.4.</p>
 *
 *       <p>
 *       value contains the computed MAC value.  The MAC value is computed
 *       over the DER-encoded public key of the certificate subject.</p>
 *
 *    <p>The CA/RA identifies the shared secret to be used by looking at 1)
 *    the general name field in the certificate request or 2) either the
 *    regToken (see section 6.1) or authToken (see section 6.2) controls.</p>
