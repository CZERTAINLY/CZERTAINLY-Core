/**
 * <h6>Proof-of-Possession (POP)</h6>
 * Short fields overview:
 * <pre>
 *     ProofOfPossession ::= CHOICE {
 *          raVerified        [0] NULL,
 *          signature         [1] POPOSigningKey,
 *          keyEncipherment   [2] POPOPrivKey,
 *          keyAgreement      [3] POPOPrivKey }
 *
 *      POPOSigningKey ::= SEQUENCE {
 *          poposkInput         [0] POPOSigningKeyInput OPTIONAL,
 *          algorithmIdentifier     AlgorithmIdentifier,
 *          signature               BIT STRING }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>POP for a signature key is accomplished by performing a signature
 * operation on a piece of data containing the identity for which the
 * certificate is desired.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>There are three cases that need to be looked at when doing a POP for
 * a signature key:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 * 1.  The certificate subject has not yet established an authenticated
 *     identity with a CA/RA, but has a password and identity string
 *     from the CA/RA.  In this case, the POPOSigningKeyInput structure
 *     would be filled out using the publicKeyMAC choice for authInfo,
 *     and the password and identity would be used to compute the
 *     publicKeyMAC value.  The public key for the certificate being
 *     requested would be placed in both the POPOSigningKeyInput and the
 *     Certificate Template structures.  The signature field is computed
 *     over the DER-encoded POPOSigningKeyInput structure.</li>
 *
 *     <li>
 * 2.  The CA/RA has established an authenticated identity for the
 *     certificate subject, but the requestor is not placing it into the
 *     certificate request.  In this case, the POPOSigningKeyInput
 *     structure would be filled out using the sender choice for
 *     authInfo.  The public key for the certificate being requested
 *     would be placed in both the POPOSigningKeyInput and the
 *     Certificate Template structures.  The signature field is computed
 *     over the DER-encoded POPOSigningKeyInput structure.</li>
 * <p>
 * 3.  <li>The certificate subject places its name in the Certificate
 *     Template structure along with the public key.  In this case the
 *     poposkInput field is omitted from the POPOSigningKey structure.
 *     The signature field is computed over the DER-encoded certificate
 *     template structure.</li>
 * </ul>
