-- Until a failed challenge invalidated its authorization and order, a failure left both pending behind the
-- challenge that recorded it. Such an authorization can never settle: the challenge is final and is not
-- validated again, and once the authorization expires it is refused rather than reported as invalid. These
-- rows are settled the way a failure is recorded now. An order that has already requested or received a
-- certificate is left as it is, because the certificate exists regardless of how the order reached that state.
-- Share row exclusive keeps concurrent writers out while the repair runs without blocking readers. A request
-- that read one of these rows before the repair and writes it back afterwards still wins that write; an
-- exclusive lock would prevent it, but a request holding its read locks across a challenge validation
-- could then deadlock against the migration and fail the start-up.
