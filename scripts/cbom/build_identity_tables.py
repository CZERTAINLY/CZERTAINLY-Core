"""Generate the ratified cryptographic asset identity decision tables.

The table is committed at ``src/main/resources/cbom/identity-tables.json`` and read
from the classpath, so no build needs Python and no build reaches the network. This
script is what produced those bytes, and the ``Generated artifacts`` job in
``.github/workflows/build_pr.yml`` re-runs it on every pull request and fails if one
byte differs -- which is what makes the committed file reviewable without reading it.

Regenerate after changing any input::

    python3 scripts/cbom/build_identity_tables.py \
        --output src/main/resources/cbom/identity-tables.json

A regeneration that moves the bytes re-keys the cryptographic asset inventory, so the
SHA-256 pinned by ``IdentityTablesTest`` has to be ratified in the same commit.

Inputs live under ``src/main/cbom/identity``. The CycloneDX registry snapshot provides
families and elliptic-curve equivalence data; the OID strand and grammar tables are
ratified OmniTrust decisions that have no complete upstream source.

# NOTE ON PATTERN DESIGN: every rule here is used for BOTH matching a family and
# SUBSTITUTING the matched text out of the variant residue. A rule must therefore not
# consume characters another slot needs — `^RSA-?\d` ate the leading digit of a key
# size, so `RSA4096` kept `096` as a variant and split from `RSA-4096` across 23 corpus
# rows. Use a lookahead when the pattern needs to see a character it must not eat.
#
# Ordered, word-guarded name grammar. Order IS the rule: the first match wins, so
# every entry that could be a prefix or infix of a later one must come first.
# Guards are on [A-Za-z0-9] adjacency rather than on separators, because the real
# hazards are unseparated: RSAES-OAEP contains AES, HMACSHA2 contains SHA,
# "design" contains DES. The class is ASCII on purpose: a non-ASCII letter counts as a
# word boundary, so `ÉEd25519` elects EdDSA. That is the same ASCII-only reading every
# fold in the keyed path applies, and it keeps the guard independent of the runtime's
# Unicode tables.
# ``AsciiText.PYTHON_WHITESPACE`` again, spelled for a character class inside an emitted
# pattern. A guard written with an ASCII space only is defeated by the one character this
# codebase repeatedly documents as arriving from producer text pasted out of a document:
# ``familyFromName`` matches the raw component name, with no whitespace collapse in front of it.
# Spelled as escape sequences, not as the characters themselves: both engines read `\t`, `\xhh`
# and `\uhhhh` the same way, and the artifact stays ASCII, where a literal no-break space would be
# invisible in every diff of the file whose whole purpose is to be diffed.

# Padding aliases and the sentinel. `PKCS5` and `PKCS7` are the same scheme — PKCS#5 was
# specified for 8-byte blocks and PKCS#7 generalised it, so for every cipher in this
# vocabulary they are identical and splitting on the spelling is wrong. `PKCS1` is the
# short spelling of `PKCS1V15`. `RAW` means "no padding", which is what an omitted field
# also means, so it folds to absent rather than splitting a declaring producer from an
# omitting one — the same lesson the `primitive` slot taught.
# `RAW` deliberately does NOT fold to absent. Folding it was tried and reverted: `RAW`
# is a POSITIVE assertion — "this construction uses no padding" — whereas an absent field
# means "not stated". That is the same distinction the CBOM Profiles review established
# for `other`/`unknown`, and collapsing the two merges a declared-unpadded construction
# with an undisclosed one. The gold corpus pinned it (GOLD-ALG-15) and caught the
# inconsistency.

# The mode vocabulary is the CycloneDX `mode` enum minus `unknown`, which is a genuine

# list", and stripping it folded such an asset onto one that said nothing at all.
# It is deliberately SEPARATE from the size stoplist: WRAP, KW, KWP, POLY1305 and the
# PKCS paddings all belong in the stoplist so their digits are never read as a key
# size, but none of them is a legal `mode` value. Treating WRAP as a mode split
# `AES-256-WRAP-PAD` from `AES256WrapPad` - the same RFC 5649 algorithm - because the

# Ratified 2026-08-19: only genuine placeholders belong here. `none` and `other` were on
# this list and came off — both are legal CycloneDX values that carry meaning, and folding
# them onto "nothing said" throws a claim away: `padding: none` is explicitly unpadded,
# which is the finding an inventory exists to surface, and `mode: other` says the mode is
# real but outside the enum. `N/A` is redundant (it folds onto `n/a`) and `0.0.0.0` is a

# exit 0 and killed every crypto asset at startup; `\v` is U+000B to Python and a vertical-whitespace
# class to Java, so both compiled and the two automata disagreed with nothing red anywhere. `\Z`
# admits a trailing terminator in Java and not in Python, `\A` goes with it, and `\1`..`\9` are
# back-references no table uses. `\x` and `\u` are here because `\xhh` and `\uhhhh` read alike in
# both and the guard-separator class is spelled with them. `\s`, `\d` and `\w` are NOT refused:
# both engines accept them, and they agree only because the reference compiles under `re.ASCII`
# -- under Python's default Unicode flags `\s` admits U+00A0, `\d` U+0669 and `\w` U+00E9, where
# Java admits none of the three -- so dropping that flag would change what the shipped `\s` and `\d`
# patterns mean without touching a pattern. What Python cannot compile (`\h`, `\R`, `\z`, `\Q`,
# `\p{..}`, `\cA`) never reaches this list.
#
# Legality is decided per POSITION, not per escape. `\b` and `\B` are portable only outside a
# character class: as word boundaries the engines agree (Java 21's `\b` is ASCII unless
# UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS is set), but inside a class Python reads `[\b]` as a backspace and Java
# refuses `\b` and `\B` alike -- so a rule spelled `[\b]AES` passed a single allowlist with exit 0,
# reproduced byte-for-byte, and killed `IdentityTables.load()` at startup, which is verbatim the
# failure this screen exists to prevent.

    every identity test. Python's nested-set ``FutureWarning`` (``[[``, ``&&``, ``--`` inside a
    class) is promoted to an error: Java reads those as set operations and Python as literals.

    Compiled under ``re.ASCII`` as well as ``re.IGNORECASE``, because the flags have to match the

    ``UNICODE_CASE`` is set with it, and its ``\\s`` and ``\\d`` are ASCII, while Python's defaults
    are Unicode-aware for both. Compiling under Python's wider semantics would accept a pattern on
    terms Java never applies.

    What this establishes is that both engines *accept* the construct, not that they *match* the
